# pandas-challenge
Module 4 challenge
This was such a fun challenge and I still am feeling behind as I know I am taking longer than most, but this was such a fun way to see how pandas can be used to analyze data.

The analysis started with pulling in some csv files that contained data about schools and their types in certain districts with math and reading scores. I was to take this data and do quite a bit of an analysis. 

We first started with getting data from the grades themselves to see how many students of everyone was passing or failing and then taking the averages.

We moved into a deeper analysis by going by schools themselves and breaking down their budgets, school size, how much each student costs in their budget, etc. This was a fun and challenging excercise to use the wonders of Pandas.

After that we dove even deeper to show scores by spending, size, and type which was awesome to see how you could easily correlate data after you figure out the puzzle of how to separate it all.



For my 2 conclusions in this data:

    1. From my analysis on the highest passing and lowest passing you can easily tell that just because you are spending more or have a bigger budget, does not correlate to higher grades. It looks as though the smaller schools tend to perform better on an average basis.
    
    
    2. I will find a comparison in that the Charter schools greatly outperformed the District schools. The overall passing percentage being a large difference was a big surprise to me.
